5. Error messages leak user existence

[... full analysis ...]

🔍 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Test with SQL injection payloads
- [ ] Test rate limiting with 100 requests

```

### Example 3: Code Review Only

```

CC10x: Starting REVIEW workflow...

[Spawning 4 reviewers in parallel...]

Security review: CRITICAL issues found (1)
Performance review: MODERATE issues found (2)
Quality review: MINOR issues found (3)
UX review: MODERATE issues found (1)

Consolidated findings:

🚨 CRITICAL (1):
- Hardcoded API key in config.js:23
  Fix: Move to environment variable

⚠️ MODERATE (3):
- Loading all users into memory (users.js:45)
  Fix: Add pagination
- Missing keyboard navigation (form.jsx:89)
  Fix: Add onKeyDown handlers
- Color-only error indicators (styles.css:12)
  Fix: Add icons/text

📉 MINOR (3):
- Function too long (auth.js:100-250)
- Duplicate validation logic
- Variable naming unclear

🛑 How to proceed? [fix-all / fix-critical / proceed]

## ✨ Key Features

### Automatic Intent Detection
CC10x recognizes what you want and routes to the right workflow:
- "plan feature X" → Planning workflow
- "build with TDD" → Building workflow
- "review code" → Review workflow
- "deploy safely" → Deployment workflow

### Parallel Execution
Multiple specialized agents work simultaneously:
- **4 agents** in planning (context, locator, analyzer, pattern-finder)
- **4 reviewers** in review (security, performance, quality, UX)
- Reduces wall-clock time significantly

### Systematic Quality Gates
Every phase includes verification:
- **Planning:** 8-dimension risk analysis
- **Building:** RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles
- **Review:** Multi-dimensional analysis
- **Deploy:** Staged rollout with rollback

### Human Checkpoints
Critical decisions require human approval:
- After planning: Approve approach
- After each build phase: Verify manually
- After review: Decide what to fix
- Before deployment: Approve strategy

### Risk-First Approach
"What Could Go Wrong?" analysis at every phase:
- Planning: Identify risks before coding
- Building: Check risks before each phase
- Review: Compare actual vs planned risks
- Deploy: Analyze deployment risks

## 🎓 How It Works

### 1. Intent Detection

CC10x analyzes your message and detects intent:

```
"plan authentication" → PLANNING workflow
"implement with tests" → BUILDING workflow
"check security" → REVIEW workflow (security focus)
"ready to deploy" → DEPLOYMENT workflow
```

### 2. Workflow Execution

Each workflow follows a structured process:

**PLANNING:**
1. Gather context (parallel agents)
2. Analyze risks (8 dimensions)
3. Create implementation plan
4. Human checkpoint

**BUILDING:**
1. RED: Write failing test
2. GREEN: Make it pass
3. REFACTOR: Improve structure
4. Automated verification
5. Human checkpoint (manual testing)
6. Repeat for each phase

**REVIEW:**
1. Spawn 4 reviewers (parallel)
2. Consolidate findings
3. Prioritize by severity
4. Human checkpoint (fix what?)

**DEPLOY:**
1. Create staged rollout plan
2. Define rollback procedures
3. Setup monitoring
4. Human checkpoint (approve?)

### 3. Progressive Loading

Skills load details only when needed:
- Start with overview
- Load workflows on demand
- Load dimensions progressively
- Minimize token usage
